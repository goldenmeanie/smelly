A very local map (currently) of lilac bushes in Providence, RIâ€” that are accessible from the sidewalk.

The map is at [smellymap.us](https://smellymap.us)

I made the [custom style with MapBox](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/goldenmeanie/cjirs8gwb2o8e2snxffn69osy.html?title=copy&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ29sZGVubWVhbmllIiwiYSI6IjRiNmIyNmI1NDE5MDA1MGRjYzNjNzhhMjNmNjUyN2M1In0.gT4HUhlPjQdEbmS9u4Fs7g&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#10.82/41.7662/-71.339)

This is really only relevant for about two weeks in the spring.
