A very local map (currently) of lilac bushes in Providence, RI that are accessible from the sidewalk.

The map is at [goldenmeanie.net/lilac-walk](http://goldenmeanie.net/lilac-walk)

I made the [custom style with MapBox](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/goldenmeanie/cimnj3beo004eb7nkqftc331e.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ29sZGVubWVhbmllIiwiYSI6IjRiNmIyNmI1NDE5MDA1MGRjYzNjNzhhMjNmNjUyN2M1In0.gT4HUhlPjQdEbmS9u4Fs7g#13.740941694434506/41.84255096844072/-71.39043627906528/0
)

## To-Do:
- Move data into YAML to make my brain hurt less
- Add metadata to the points for notes (accessibility, size, name, etc.)
- Add other smelly plants (hence the name)
